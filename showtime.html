It does not means meek submission to the will of the evil-doer, but it means the putting of one's whole soul against the will of the tyrant.

      After a particularly destructive war where he conquered a large swath of present-day Southern India, Ashoka turned to Buddhism and abolished war. His rule thereafter was of peace and plenty.<br /><br />
      In a species whose lust for power is barely matched by its tolerance and glorification of murder to attain that power, Ashoka's willingness to lay down the sword and embrace peace is singular.

      Narada, son of Brahma, the creator deity of the Hindu Trinity. Narada's an ardent devotee of Vishnu, the "preserver" aspect of the Trinity whose incarnations as Rama and Krishna are the bases for the Hindu epics <i>Ramayana</i> and <i>Mahabharata</i>. Vishnu's the friendly, four-armed fellow smiling in the background.
      <br /><br />
      Narada strives for spiritual enlightenment through conquering his desires. He means well, but is prone to bragging. Whenever he proudly tells Vishnu that he's conquered desire once and for all, Vishnu slyly catches Narada off-guard and proves that he still has a ways to go. I find Narada's quixotic quest for enlightenment (known as <i>moksha</i> in the Hindu tradition) deeply inspiring, and consider myself on the same journey.

      Ta-Nehisi Coates &mdash; <i>Between The World And Me</i>

      <blockquote>
      Serious history was the West, and the West was white. This was all distilled for me in a quote I once read from the novelist Saul Bellow. I can’t remember where I read it, or when only that I was already at Howard. “Who is the Tolstoy of the Zulus?” Bellow quipped. Tolstoy was “white,” and so Tolstoy “mattered,” like everything else that was white “mattered.”<br /><br />
      . . . It must have been around that time that I discovered an essay by Ralph Wiley in which he responded to Bellow’s quip. “Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus,” wrote Wiley. “Unless you find a profit in fencing off universal properties of mankind into exclusive tribal ownership.” And there it was. I had accepted Bellow’s premise. In fact, Bellow was no closer to Tolstoy than I was to Nzinga. And if I were closer it would be because I chose to be, not because of destiny written in DNA. My great error was not that I had accepted someone else’s dream but that I had accepted the fact of dreams, the need for escape, and the invention of racecraft.

      	Jin Wang’s story is fictional, but I pulled heavily from my own life.  I think anyone who’s grown up as a minority has experienced something similar, regardless of what makes them a minority.  Like many of us, I experienced the most virulent bullying during my junior high years.  And I also did my most virulent bullying during those same years.  Like Jin, I was both bullied and a bully.  And like Jin, I had to both forgive and seek forgiveness.

      Jeez. Relax. You're a monkey barely out of the trees. Look at you! You had to be trained to not shit yourself. And it took years. Now you're thousands of miles from the savannah, wrapped in plant fiber and animal skin to keep warm, and you're walking around grumbling about how some other monkeys don't like what kind of monkey you are.<br /><br />
      Go climb a tree or jump in a lake. Howl at the moon! Dig a wild flower and gift it to a monkey you like! But for God's sake, don't spend your short little monkey life sad. That's like finding out you only get one piece of fruit, then picking the moldy apple below the tree!

		Now science has filled in some of the realm  not all  that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.
